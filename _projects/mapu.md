# Introduction

MaPU (**Ma**thematical **P**rocessing **U**nit) is a novel architecture targeting data-intensive computing with great power efficiency and sustained computation throughput. 
To achieve this goal, MaPU uses mathematical formulates style program model, directly mapped data path on CGRA fabric 
and groundbreaking memory system that supports *simultaneous row-major and column major matrix with the same layout*.
